**Project Title:** Static Website
**Tagline:** A Simple yet Effective Static Website Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

**üìñ Description**
===============

Welcome to our Static Website project! This project is designed to showcase the simplicity and effectiveness of building a static website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website has two main pages: Register and Login. The Register page allows users to sign up for an account, and the Login page allows users to log in to their account.

The website is built using modern web development standards, including HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The CSS uses a preprocessor to generate the CSS files, and the JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the website. The website is designed to be responsive, meaning it will adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
